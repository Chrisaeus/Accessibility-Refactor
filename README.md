# Christian's Accessibility Refactor

## What the hell is even this?

My assignment was to refactor an existing webpage to make it more accessible.

This was accomplished by adding a title to the page's head, replacing `<div>` tags with contextual semantics tags (such as `<section>` and `<nav>`), and adding `alt` attributes to `<img>` tags. This allows a screen reader to relay the information on the page more accurately.

I also edited the CSS file to be cleaner and more efficient by annotating sections of code with comments and consolidating classes with identical properties in order to declutter the document from repetitive and redundant code. I believe this is an example of the **scout rule**.

## Here's what the page looks like (I didn't break it!)
